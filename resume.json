    "summary": "Hi! Allow me to briefly introduce myself. Bohdan Herasymenko from Ukraine. 25 years old. Grew up in an industrial city of Kharkiv. In 2016 received Master's degree at National University of Economics, speciality: Informational Management Systems and Technologies. Began working being the 4th year student and instantly realized  w Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!",
